*Sweet Home*

**A 10-episode Korean web series that released in 2020 on Netflix, Sweet Home trained its focus on a motley crew of residents that inhabit a run-down housing complex, their stories, and the subsequent struggle for answers as to whether humanity will prevail in a crumbling world overrun by monsters**

**Sweet Home is a television series based on the Webtoon of the same name by Kim Kan-bi and Hwang Young-chan. Released by Netflix, the series tells the story of loner Cha Hyun-Su who moves to a new apartment after the death of his family in an accident.**

*As humans turn into savage monsters and wreak terror, one troubled teen and his apartment neighbors fight to survive â€” and to hold on to their humanity.*
